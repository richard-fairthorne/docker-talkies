"""Optional bearer-token auth for the ASGI app.

When ``config.AUTH_TOKEN`` is non-empty, every request must include
``Authorization: Bearer <token>`` or it gets 401. Empty token = pass-through
(the historical default — the README is loud about putting this thing
behind something that does auth, but a built-in token is the lower-friction
option for self-hosters who just want one shared secret).

Exemptions: ``/healthz`` is always reachable so k8s / docker probes keep
working without leaking the token to every probe loop. ``OPTIONS``
requests (CORS preflights) are also let through — preflights aren't
allowed to send the Authorization header.

Implemented as ASGI middleware (not a FastAPI dependency) so it covers
mounted sub-apps too — specifically the MCP Streamable HTTP transport at
``/v1/mcp``, which is a Starlette app mounted into FastAPI.
