# talkies setup

## Requirements

- Docker
- `linux/amd64` host (no arm64 images — `nemo_toolkit[asr]` + chain doesn't resolve cleanly on aarch64)
- Optional: NVIDIA GPU + NVIDIA Container Toolkit for the CUDA image
- ~3 GB disk for the CPU image, ~9 GB for the CUDA image
- ~13 GB additional disk for model weights (CPU image set, includes Kokoro ~330 MB) or ~30 GB (full CUDA set)
- ~4 GB RAM minimum (whisper-large-v3 needs the working set + overhead); 12 GB+ VRAM for the GPU-only models

## Quick Install

### CPU

Serves 3× Whisper + `canary-180m-flash` for ASR, plus `kokoro-82m` for TTS. The CUDA-only ASR models aren't worth running on CPU.

```bash
docker run -d --name talkies \
  -v $HOME/talkies-models:/data \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  psyb0t/talkies:latest
```

### CUDA

Serves all seven ASR models plus `kokoro-82m` TTS. Requires the NVIDIA Container Toolkit on the host.

```bash
docker run -d --name talkies \
  --gpus all \
  -v $HOME/talkies-models:/data \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  psyb0t/talkies:latest-cuda
```

The CUDA image also runs without `--gpus all` — it binds to CPU, ignores CUDA env vars, and refuses the GPU-only slugs at first call. Useful for debugging without a GPU host.

**Verify:** `curl http://localhost:8000/healthz` returns `{"ok": true, "device": "...", "models": [...]}` once boot's done.

**First boot:** the entrypoint downloads every model in `models.json` into `/data/models/<slug>/`. CPU set is ~13 GB (includes Kokoro), CUDA full set is ~30 GB. Bind-mount `/data` so subsequent restarts are no-ops. Restrict the download set with `TALKIES_ENABLED_MODELS` to avoid pulling everything.

## CPU vs CUDA Images

| Image | Tag | Platforms | Models served | Image size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CPU | `psyb0t/talkies:latest` | `linux/amd64` | 3× Whisper, 1× Canary-180m-Flash, Kokoro-82M | ~3 GB |
| CUDA | `psyb0t/talkies:latest-cuda` | `linux/amd64` | all seven ASR + Kokoro-82M | ~9 GB |

The CPU image only ships ASR models that actually finish in a sane time without a GPU. Parakeet-TDT is autoregressive (slow on CPU). Canary-1B and Canary-Qwen-2.5B are flat-out too big. Use the CUDA image for those even if you mostly run on CPU — it gracefully falls back. Kokoro-82M ships in both images — at 82M params it synthesizes faster than real-time on a 4-core CPU, no GPU needed.

Both images bake `espeak-ng` into the runtime layer because Kokoro's G2P for es/fr/hi/it/pt routes through it via `misaki.espeak.EspeakG2P`. The Python `kokoro==0.9.4` package and its lightweight dependency chain (`misaki`, no `[ja]` / `[zh]` extras) are pinned alongside the rest of the ML stack in `Dockerfile` / `Dockerfile.cuda`.

## Environment Variables

### Auth + bind

| Var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `TALKIES_AUTH_TOKEN` | (empty = no auth) | Bearer token required on every route except `/healthz`. Empty/unset = wide open (historical default — fine on private networks). When set, `Authorization: Bearer <token>` required on every HTTP request AND every MCP call. Compared with `hmac.compare_digest`. |

Container binds `0.0.0.0:8000` unconditionally. Control network exposure at `docker run` time:
- `-p 127.0.0.1:8000:8000` — loopback-only on the host.
- `-p 8000:8000` — all host interfaces.
- For untrusted networks, combine the token with a reverse proxy doing TLS + rate limiting.

### Device + model registry

| Var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `TALKIES_DEVICE` | `auto` | `auto` picks `cuda` if available else `cpu`. Pin to a specific GPU with `cuda:N`. |
| `TALKIES_MODELS_FILE` | `/app/models.json` | Path to the model registry JSON. Override to ship a custom subset. CPU image defaults to `/app/models-cpu.json` automatically. |
| `TALKIES_ENABLED_MODELS` | (empty = all from `models.json`) | Comma-separated slug whitelist. Restricts both the boot-time snapshot download and the queryable surface of `/v1/models`. Unknown slugs fail fast on startup. |
| `TALKIES_PRELOAD` | (empty) | Comma-separated slugs to load into RAM/VRAM at boot, before uvicorn accepts requests. Skips cold-load on first transcription. Must be a subset of `TALKIES_ENABLED_MODELS`. |

### Data dir

| Var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `TALKIES_DATA_DIR` | `/data` | Base data dir. Model snapshots → `$TALKIES_DATA_DIR/models/<slug>/` (flat per-model dirs, no HF cache layout). Staged uploads + URL downloads → `$TALKIES_DATA_DIR/files/`. Bind-mount to persist across restarts. |

### Lifecycle (idle sweeper + load timeouts)

| Var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `TALKIES_MODEL_TTL` | `600` (10 min) | Idle time before a loaded backend is unloaded by the sweeper. Bare number = seconds; also accepts Go-style `3h30m5s`, `45m`, `90s`. `0` disables auto-unload. |
| `TALKIES_SWEEPER_INTERVAL` | `60` | How often the sweeper checks for idle models. |
| `TALKIES_LOAD_TIMEOUT` | `300` | Per-model load timeout. Initial weights download + warmup runs inside this budget. |

### Upload + download caps

| Var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `TALKIES_MAX_UPLOAD_BYTES` | `104857600` (100 MB) | Reject `POST /v1/audio/transcriptions` multipart `file` and `PUT /v1/files/{path}` bodies larger than this with 413. |
| `TALKIES_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES` | `1073741824` (1 GiB) | Abort URL downloads (when `file_path` is an http(s) URL) larger than this. Larger default because downloads stream straight to disk, no in-memory buffering. |
| `TALKIES_BLOCK_PRIVATE_DOWNLOADS` | `false` | Set to `true` to refuse URL downloads whose hostname resolves to private/loopback/link-local/multicast/reserved IPs. Default `false` because the typical self-hosted deployment is a LAN box fetching from another LAN box. Flip to `true` if exposed to untrusted clients. |

### VAD knobs

Audio longer than `TALKIES_VAD_CHUNK_THRESHOLD` seconds gets sliced through Silero VAD into ≤`TALKIES_VAD_MAX_SPEECH`-second speech regions before being handed to the backend.

| Var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `TALKIES_VAD_CHUNK_THRESHOLD` | `30.0` | Audio longer than this (seconds) goes through VAD chunking. Shorter clips skip it. |
| `TALKIES_VAD_MAX_SPEECH` | `28.0` | Max length of a single VAD-detected speech region (seconds). Should stay under Whisper's 30 s internal window. |
| `TALKIES_VAD_MIN_SILENCE_MS` | `500` | Silero VAD param — minimum gap (ms) to consider a region break. |
| `TALKIES_VAD_SPEECH_PAD_MS` | `200` | Silero VAD param — silence padding (ms) around each detected speech region. |
| `TALKIES_VAD_THRESHOLD` | `0.5` | Silero VAD speech-probability threshold. Lower = more aggressive. |

### Internal

| Var | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `HF_HUB_OFFLINE` | `1` (in image) | Refuse network calls from HuggingFace Hub at runtime. The entrypoint transparently unsets it for the one-shot prefetch step so the initial download works; the server process itself runs offline. Don't touch unless debugging. |

## Common Configurations

```bash
# Restrict to just the small/fast models (saves first-boot download time).
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 \
  -e TALKIES_ENABLED_MODELS=whisper-large-v3-turbo,canary-180m-flash \
  -v $HOME/talkies-models:/data \
  psyb0t/talkies:latest

# Preload at boot so the first request doesn't pay the cold-load tax.
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 \
  -e TALKIES_ENABLED_MODELS=whisper-large-v3-turbo \
  -e TALKIES_PRELOAD=whisper-large-v3-turbo \
  -v $HOME/talkies-models:/data \
  psyb0t/talkies:latest

# Bearer auth on a public-facing deployment.
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 \
  -e TALKIES_AUTH_TOKEN=$(openssl rand -hex 32) \
  -e TALKIES_BLOCK_PRIVATE_DOWNLOADS=true \
  -v $HOME/talkies-models:/data \
  psyb0t/talkies:latest

# Loopback only (rely on reverse proxy for external access).

  -v $HOME/talkies-models:/data \
  psyb0t/talkies:latest-cuda
```

## Ports

| Port | Service |
| ---- | ------- |
| 8000 | HTTP API + MCP (`/v1/mcp`) on the same port |

Container binds `0.0.0.0:8000` unconditionally — there are no `TALKIES_HOST` / `TALKIES_PORT` env vars (they were removed in v0.2.0). Use `-p` at `docker run` time for whatever host port mapping you want.

## Customizing the Model Registry

The image ships with `models.json` (CUDA) or `models-cpu.json` (CPU) baked in. Override without rebuilding by bind-mounting your own:

```bash
docker run -d --name talkies \
  -v $HOME/talkies-models:/data \
  -v $PWD/my-models.json:/app/models.json:ro \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  psyb0t/talkies:latest
```

Or point `TALKIES_MODELS_FILE` at a different path inside the container.

File structure:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "your-asr-slug": {
      "repo": "huggingface-org/repo-name",
      "executor": "whisper",
      "default_source_lang": "en",
      "default_target_lang": "en",
      "default_task": "asr",
      "languages": ["en"]
    },
    "your-tts-slug": {
      "repo": "huggingface-org/tts-repo-name",
      "executor": "kokoro",
      "modality": "tts",
      "default_voice": "af_heart",
      "languages": ["en"]
    }
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `repo` | yes | HuggingFace repo id. Pulled via `snapshot_download(local_dir=$TALKIES_DATA_DIR/models/<slug>)` — flat directory keyed by slug, no HF cache indirection. |
| `executor` | yes | One of `whisper`, `parakeet`, `canary_multitask`, `canary_salm`, `kokoro`. Other values fail startup. |
| `modality` | no | `asr` (default) or `tts`. Drives endpoint guards (`/v1/audio/transcriptions` requires ASR; `/v1/audio/speech` requires TTS) and the `modality` field on `/v1/models` entries. The `kokoro` executor implies `tts`; the four ASR executors imply `asr`. |
| `default_source_lang` | no | ASR only. Used when the request omits `language`. |
| `default_target_lang` | no | ASR only. Used by Canary multitask for translation tasks. |
| `default_task` | no | ASR only. `asr` (transcribe) or `s2t_translation` (Canary multitask only). Default `asr`. |
| `default_voice` | no | TTS only. Used when the request omits `voice`. Falls back to the first voice the backend reports. |
| `languages` | no | Informational only — listed in error messages, not enforced. |
| `dependencies` | no | List of extra HuggingFace repo ids the executor needs at load time (e.g. `canary-qwen-2.5b` instantiates a Qwen3 tokenizer separately). Each is `snapshot_download`'d into the standard HF cache (`HF_HOME`) at entrypoint. |

### Common customization: translation slugs

The shipped `models.json` ships every Canary slug with `default_task=asr`, so out of the box the API only transcribes. To enable translation (Canary-1B-Flash covers en↔de/fr/es), add a translation-specific slug:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "canary-1b-flash-de2en": {
      "repo": "nvidia/canary-1b-flash",
      "executor": "canary_multitask",
      "default_source_lang": "de",
      "default_target_lang": "en",
      "default_task": "s2t_translation",
      "languages": ["de"]
    },
    "canary-1b-flash-en2de": {
      "repo": "nvidia/canary-1b-flash",
      "executor": "canary_multitask",
      "default_source_lang": "en",
      "default_target_lang": "de",
      "default_task": "s2t_translation",
      "languages": ["en"]
    }
  }
}
```

Multiple slugs can point at the same HF repo — talkies loads the underlying weights once and changes the prompt format per slug.

### Common customization: restricting to one model

For a single-purpose deployment, ship a one-entry registry to skip pulling everything:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "whisper-large-v3-turbo": {
      "repo": "deepdml/faster-whisper-large-v3-turbo-ct2",
      "executor": "whisper",
      "default_source_lang": "en",
      "languages": ["en"]
    }
  }
}
```

Equivalent to setting `TALKIES_ENABLED_MODELS=whisper-large-v3-turbo` against the default registry — but with a custom registry you can add slugs that aren't in the shipped one.

## OpenClaw / ClawHub Config

```bash
export TALKIES_URL=http://localhost:8000
export TALKIES_AUTH_TOKEN=<token>  # only if the server requires it
```

Or via `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:

```json
{
  "skills": {
    "entries": {
      "talkies": {
        "env": {
          "TALKIES_URL": "http://localhost:8000",
          "TALKIES_AUTH_TOKEN": "<token>"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Management

```bash
docker logs -f talkies    # tail logs
docker stop talkies       # stop
docker rm talkies         # remove
docker pull psyb0t/talkies:latest  # update
```

Watch what's loaded right now:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8000/api/ps | jq
```

Free memory between jobs:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/unload | jq
```

## Logs

`docker logs talkies` covers everything. Look for:

- `entrypoint:` lines on boot — model snapshot downloads, device detection.
- `INFO talkies.server` lines on each request — model load events, transcribe timings.
- `WARNING` / `ERROR` lines for backend failures.

The server doesn't log auth tokens, request bodies, or audio bytes. It logs the model slug, request id, duration, and result size — nothing else.

## Public Access via Reverse Proxy (optional)

talkies binds `0.0.0.0:8000` inside the container. For public exposure, terminate TLS at a reverse proxy (Caddy / Traefik / nginx) and combine with `TALKIES_AUTH_TOKEN`.

Caddy example:

```caddy
talkies.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:8000
}
```

Set the auth token on the talkies container so even if Caddy is misconfigured, the upstream still requires `Authorization: Bearer`. Don't rely on the proxy alone.

For Cloudflare Tunnel / Tailscale, the same logic applies — the tunnel provides transport security, the bearer token provides app-layer auth.
